Today was the [defense](https://en.itu.dk/Research/PhD-Programme/PhD-Defences/PhD-Defences-2023/November/Rene-Haas) of the very first PhD student I had the pleasure to officially co-supervise: René Haas. I could not be prouder. Shortly, after I started working at ITU 2019 we started working together with Sami S. Brandt, on a research project titled *Synthesis of Face Images Using Generative Algorithms*. This project was then extended into a Master thesis *Exploring the latent space of StyleGAN for semantic face editing and expression transfer*. 
This lead to a proposal for a PhD project, which got accepted, and the rest is history!

And finally today René defended his thesis with the title *Deep Generative Models for Faces and Expressions* with great success. 
A big thank you also to the committee members [Veronika Cheplygina](https://veronikach.com/), [Fredrik Kahl](https://fredkahl.github.io/), and [Samuli Laine](https://users.aalto.fi/~laines9/).
