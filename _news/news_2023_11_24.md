Today was the defense of the very first student I had the pleasure to officially co-supervise as a PhD student: René Haas, and I could not be prouder. 
Shortly, after I started working at ITU 2019 we started working together with Sami S. Brandt, on a research project, followed by a Master thesis. This lead to a proposal for a PhD project, which got accepted. Today René defended his thesis with great success. 
A big thank you also to the committee!
