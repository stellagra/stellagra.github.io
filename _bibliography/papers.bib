	abstract = {We compare the performance of an intensity based nonparametric image registration algorithm and extensions applied to frame interpolation of mouth images. The mouth exhibits large deformations due to different shapes, additionally some facial features occlude others, e.g. the lips cover the teeth. The closures and disclosures represent a challenging problem, which cannot be solved by the traditional image registration algorithms. 
 
The tested extensions include local regularizer weight adaptation, incorporation of landmarks, self-occlusion handling and penalization of folds, which have all been examined with different weight parameters. 
 
Since the performance of these algorithms and extensions turns out to be superior in case of mouth closures, we provide an algorithm for the automatic selection of deformable template and static reference image for the registration procedure. Subjective tests show that the quality of results for interpolation of mouth images is enhanced by this proposal.},

To overcome this problem, we propose a novel solution: Given facial feature points, we propose to estimate the model parameters in subsets in which they are uncorrelated. Additionally we present a term to penalize topologically incorrect triangular mesh configurations. As a result the average mean squared error between facial feature points and model vertices is reduced by 90\%, while face topology is preserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new statistical model for human faces. Our approach is built upon a tensor factorisation model that allows controlled estimation, morphing and transfer of new facial shapes and expressions. We propose a direct parametrisation and regularisation for person and expression related terms so that the training database is well utilised. In contrast to existing works we are the first to reveal that the expression subspace is star shaped. This stems from the fact that increasing the strength of an expression approximately forms a linear trajectory in the expression subspace, and all these linear trajectories intersect in a single point which corresponds to the point of no expression or the point of apathy. After centring our analysis to this point, we then demonstrate how the dimensionality of the expression subspace can be further reduced by projection pursuit with the help of the fourth-order moment tensor. The results show that our method is able to achieve convincing separation of the person specific and expression subspaces as well as flexible, natural modelling of facial expressions for wide variety of human faces. By the proposed approach, one can morph between different persons and different expressions even if they do not exist in the database. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, the morphing works without causing strong deformations. In the application of expression classification, the results are also better.},

For challenging problems such as the reconstruction of human faces, state-of-the-art approaches estimate statistical shape spaces from training data. It is common practice to use orthographic or weak-perspective camera models to map 3D to 2D points. We propose to use a projective camera model combined with a multilinear tensor-based face model, enabling approximation of a dense 3D face surface by sparse 2D landmarks. Using a projective camera is beneficial, as it is able to handle perspective projections and particular camera motions which are critical for affine models. We show how the nonlinearity of the projective model can be linearized so that its parameters can be estimated by an alternating-least-squares approach. This enables simple and fast estimation of the model parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using challenging real image data.},

We use our proposed feature to temporally align multiple sequences of recorded 3D facial expressions.

	abstract = {We propose a general, prior-free approach for the uncalibrated non-rigid structure-from-motion problem for modelling and analysis of non-rigid objects such as human faces. We recover the non-rigid affine structure and motion from 2D point correspondences by assuming that (1) the non-rigid shapes are generated by a linear combination of rigid 3D basis shapes, (2) that the non-rigid shapes are affine in nature, i.e., they can be modelled as deviations from the mean, rigid shape, (3) and that the basis shapes are statistically independent. In contrast to the majority of existing works, no statistical prior is assumed for the structure and motion apart from the assumption that underlying basis shapes are statistically independent. The independent 3D shape bases are recovered by independent subspace analysis (ISA). Likewise, in contrast to the most previous approaches, no calibration information is assumed for affine cameras; the reconstruction is solved up to a global affine ambiguity that makes our approach simple and efficient. In the experiments, we evaluated the method with several standard data sets including a real face expression data set of 7200 faces with 2D point correspondences and unknown 3D structure and motion for which we obtained promising results.},

Investigation of the expression subspace reveals an inherent low-dimensional substructure, and further, a star-shaped structure. This is due to two novel findings. (1) Increasing the strength of one emotion approximately forms a linear trajectory in the subspace. (2) All these trajectories intersect at a single point – not at the neutral expression as assumed by almost all prior works—but at an apathetic expression. We utilise these structural findings by reparameterising the expression subspace by the fourth-order moment tensor centred at the point of apathy. We propose a 3D face reconstruction method from single or multiple 2D projections by assuming an uncalibrated projective camera model. The non-linearity caused by the perspective projection can be neatly included into the model. The proposed algorithm separates person and expression subspaces convincingly, and enables flexible, natural modelling of expressions for a wide variety of human faces. Applying the method on independent faces showed that morphing between different persons and expressions can be performed without strong deformations.},

To this end, we propose to fit a multilinear tensor model on a structured facial expression database, which is initially embedded into latent space. We validate our approach on StyleGAN trained on FFHQ using BU-3DFE as a structured facial expression database. We show how the parameters of the multilinear tensor model can be approximated by Alternating Least Squares. Further, we introduce a stacked style-separated tensor model, defined as an ensemble of style-specific models to integrate our approach with the extended latent space of StyleGAN. We show that taking the individual styles of the extended latent space into account leads to higher model flexibility and lower reconstruction error. Finally, we do several experiments comparing our approach to former work on both GANs and multilinear models. Concretely, we analyze the expression subspace and find that the expression trajectories meet at an apathetic face that is consistent with earlier work. We also show that by changing the pose of a person, the generated image from our approach is closer to the ground truth than results from two competing approaches.},

To the NRSFM problem part we further present a novel prior-free approach that factorises the 2D input shapes into affine projection matrices, rank-one 3D affine basis shapes, and the basis shape coefficients. The linear combination of the basis shapes thus yields the recovered 3D shapes upto an affine transformation. In contrast to most works in literature, no calibration information of the cameras or structure prior is required.

These latent space directions are employed to change the expression or yaw rotation of real face images. We compare our found directions to similar directions found by two other methods. The results show that the visual quality of the resultant edits are on par with State-of-the-Art. It can also be concluded that the tensor-based model is well suited for emotion and yaw editing, i.e., that the emotion or yaw rotation of a novel face image can be robustly changed without a significant effect on identity or other attributes in the images.},

Additionally, TemPose demonstrates great versatility by achieving competitive results compared to other state-of-the-art skeleton-based models on the large-scale action recognition benchmark NTU RGB+D. Experiments are conducted to explore how different model parameter configurations affect Tem-Pose’s performance. Additionally, a qualitative analysis of the temporal attention maps suggests that the model learns to prioritize frames of specific poses relevant to different actions while formulating an intuition of each individual’s importance in the sequences.

This formulation provides an implicit dense 3D reconstruction as it enables the image synthesis of novel shapes from arbitrary view angles and non-rigid structure. The method is built upon a sparse backbone, where a neural regressor is first trained to regress parameters describing the cameras and sparse non-rigid structure directly from the latent codes. The latent trajectories associated with changes in the camera and structure parameters are then identified by estimating the local inverse of the regressor in the neighborhood of a given latent code.

	abstract = {Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) have emerged as a strong competitor to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
However, despite their widespread use in image synthesis and editing applications, their latent space is still not as well understood. Recently, a semantic latent space for DDMs, coined `h-space', was shown to facilitate semantic image editing in a way reminiscent of GANs. The h-space is comprised of the bottleneck activations in the DDM's denoiser across all timesteps of the diffusion process. In this paper, we explore the properties of h-space and propose several novel methods for finding meaningful semantic directions within it. We start by studying unsupervised methods for revealing interpretable semantic directions in pretrained DDMs. Specifically, we show that interpretable directions emerge as the principal components in the latent space. Additionally, we provide a novel method for discovering image-specific semantic directions by spectral analysis of the Jacobian of the denoiser w.r.t. the latent code. 
Next, we extend the analysis by finding directions in a supervised fashion in unconditional DDMs.
We demonstrate how such directions can be found by annotating generated samples with a domain-specific attribute classifier. 
We further show how to semantically disentangle the found directions by simple linear projection.
Our approaches are applicable without requiring any architectural modifications, text-based guidance, CLIP-based optimization, or model fine-tuning.},
