If you are interested in pursuing a PhD under my supervision, please check my research interests under Projects, and publications, before contacting me. 
For Master, Bachelor and Research Projects, please see below. 

<!-- I had the pleasure of supervising over 50 student projects of various kinds as main, or co-supervisor.  -->
It is with great pleasure that I support students to follow their passion, and acquire new knowledge. 

If you are considering me as a supervisor, you can find a list of project suggestions and completed supervised projects below for inspiration.

# How to do a Great Project - General Advise
With best intentions I am sharing some general advise on written work. 
I created a github repository, currently hosted on [itu github](https://github.itu.dk/stgr/howto_student_project). 
Please be mindful that you might not be able to access it if you are not from ITU. 
(I might provide the content elsewhere upon demand.)

In general company can be involved in your project it this is of mutual benefit. 
If you are considering this, be mindful that this might come with strings attached for you, specifically an NDA. 
However it can also be a way to hel with future employment at this company. 


# My Project Proposals 
Consider the following an incomplete list of my research interests. 
Some interesting keywords for your project include but are not limited to:

- Machine Learning applications focussing on mental health, mental disorders, and health applications
- Generative AI: Diffusion Models, GANs, etc.
- Deep Fake Detection: focussing on visual domain
- Human Motion Analysis, e.g. by Vision Transformers
- 3D reconstruction
- Image Generation and Classification

More details:
- Estimation of semantically meaningful latent directions. 
You can help us improve [this repo](https://github.com/renhaa/tensorgan). Currently, the semantic directions are not part of the repository due to copyright reasons. Let's replace it with information from a public database! 


Feel free to contact me with project suggestions. Be mindful that I have a limited capacity of supervisions I am agreeing to at a time, therefore please reach out early. 
You can consider a joint supervision, which gives the opportunity to combine the knowledge of different people.  


## Projects elsewhere 
You also might want to look elsewhere at ITU. You can find interesting student projects in the following groups here:
- [daysa](https://dasya.itu.dk/for-students/proposals/)
- [nerds](https://nerds.itu.dk/students/)
- [square](https://square.itu.dk/student-projects/)

# Finalized and Ongoing Projects

In the following I will provide a list of finalized student projects which I supervised at ITU and LUH. 
The year indicates the year when it was officially finalized, i.e. the time of examination. If not stated otherwise the project was conducted by one student, otherwise you will find the number of students involved in the group project at the end of the line. 
The different abbreviations are referring to the following types
- MSc : Master thesis
- RP : Research Project
- BSc : Bachelor thesis


## Currently Ongoing student projects
Currently, I am supervising several projects focussing on applications of machine learning in the mental health domain, and other computer vision topics.
<!-- (Note that the project titles are preliminary, and might change in the final submission. ) -->

## Finalized student projects at ITU
This is a list of projects I supervised or co-supervised since I started working at ITU 2019. 

Note: This collection is work in progress. As of now: 
- Companies involved in the projects are intentionally not mentioned. 
- Co-supervisions with colleagues happen(ed), and is not (yet) always mentioned. 
- If not stated otherwise, the project has been completed by one student.
- Names will only appear if explicitly agreed. (You can always ask to have it removed later.)
- Message me if you would like your name added or removed from this page.
