<!-- pages/studentprojects.md -->
So far I had the pleasure of supervising (or being involved as a co-supervisor in) over 50 student projects of various content and different kinds. 
It is with great pleasure that I support students to follow their passion, and acquire new knowledge. 
In some cases a company was involved in the project which provides the students with valuable insights into the industry. 

If you are considering me as a supervisor, you can find a list of project suggestions and completed supervised projects below for inspiration. 


# Open Projects 
You can find some interesting keywords for project ideas here:

- Machine Learning in Mental Health applications
- Face Generation and Deep Fakes
- Fake Image Detection
- Human Motion
- 3D reconstruction
- Image Generation and Classification

(I will add more elaborate descriptions at a later point.)
Feel free to contact me with project suggestions. Be mindful that this should be rather earlier than later, because I have a limited capacity of supervisions I am agreeing to at a time. This is a concious decision to ensure the best support for your project, too. 

# Finalized and Ongoing Projects

In the following I will provide a list of finalized student projects which I supervised at ITU and LUH. 
The year indicates the year when it was officially finalized, i.e. the time of examination. If not stated otherwise the project was conducted by one student, otherwise you will find the number of students involved in the group project at the end of the line. 
The different abbreviations are referring to the following types
- MSc : Master thesis
- RP : Research Project
- BSc : Bachelor thesis

Note: I only publish the names of the students if they agreed to it. However, since this website was created 2024, I did not ask most of my previous students. 
If you are one of my former students, and would like your name listed, please message me.
