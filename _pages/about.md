I am working as an Assistant Professor at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/) at the [Department of Computer Science](https://en.itu.dk/Research/Departments/Computer-Science-Department). 
My research focus is **human-centred Machine Learning**. Specifically, I am focussing on generative AI mainly in the visual domain, and use images and videos for the analysis and synthesis of human faces and human motion. To get a better understanding of my research and interests, please check my publications, and student projects. 
Additionally, I am affiliated with the [Pioneer Centre for AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/), and board member of the [Lundbeck Foundation Investigator Network](https://lundbeckfonden.com/lfin). 

Currently, I am happily co-supervising the following three PhD bright students:
- Martin Lund Trinhammer with Sami S. Brandt
- Luiza Ribeiro Marnet with Andrzej Wąsowski and Yury Brodskiy
- Magnus Ibh with Dan Witzner Hansen and Pascal Madeleine

The first PhD student René Haas, whom I co-supervised with Sami S. Brandt, finished end of 2023, and delivered an excellent thesis.
