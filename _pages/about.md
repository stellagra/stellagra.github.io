I am working as an Assistant Professor in the Data Science section at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/) and affiliated with the [Pioneer Centre for AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/). Additionally, I am an active member and board member of the [Lundbeck Foundation Investigator Network](https://lundbeckfonden.com/lfin). 

My research focuses on  **human-centred Machine Learning**, particularly in the area of generative AI for visual data. I am working on developing models that can learn from and synthesize images, videos, and other complex data sources to analyse and synthesize human faces, human motion, and a variety of other visual patterns. While most of my current work is aimed at advancing applications in the mental health domain, my research extends across diverse visual fields, including underwater imagery and environmental monitoring. She has collaborated with industry partners on cutting-edge challenges in zero-shot learning and active learning, contributing to innovative solutions for domains where labeled data is scarce or costly to obtain.

I am grateful to be able to pursue my research in machine learning in the mental health domain with our PhD student Martin Trinhammer, who has a background in psychology. This work extents the grant I got from the Lundbeck Foundation about the same topic, where my collaboration with experts from the psychology domain is paramount. 
We aim at learning more about different mental disorders, to improve their diagnosis, personalize health care, and improve access. While this is challenging in itself, we are working on different aspects of ensuring privacy of the patient data.

Currently, I am happily co-supervising the following three bright PhD students:
- [Leo Vitasovic](https://pure.itu.dk/da/persons/leo-vitasovic) with [Sami S. Brandt](https://pure.itu.dk/da/persons/sami-brandt)
- [Martin Lund Trinhammer](https://pure.itu.dk/da/persons/martin-lund-trinhammer) with [Sami S. Brandt](https://pure.itu.dk/da/persons/sami-brandt)
- [Magnus Ibh](https://pure.itu.dk/en/persons/magnus-ibh) with [Dan Witzner Hansen](https://pure.itu.dk/en/persons/dan-witzner-hansen) and [Pascal Madeleine](https://vbn.aau.dk/da/persons/102245)
- [Luiza Ribeiro Marnet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luiza-ribeiro-marnet-378259116) with [Andrzej Wąsowski](http://www.itu.dk/people/wasowski/) and [Yury Brodskiy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yurybrodskiy/)

The first PhD student [René Haas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haasrene/?originalSubdomain=dk), whom I co-supervised with [Sami S. Brandt](https://pure.itu.dk/da/persons/sami-brandt), finished end of 2023, and delivered an excellent thesis. More details about his work can be found [here](http://stellagrasshof.com/projects/3_project/).
