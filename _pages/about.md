I am working as an Associate Professor in the Data Science section at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/) and the [Pioneer Centre for AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/). Additionally, I am an active member and board member of the [Lundbeck Foundation Investigator Network](https://lundbeckfonden.com/lfin). 

My research focuses on  **human-centred Machine Learning**, particularly in the area of generative AI for visual data. I am working on developing models that can learn from and synthesize images, videos, and other complex data sources to analyse and synthesize human faces, human motion, and a variety of other visual patterns. While most of my current work is aimed at advancing applications in the mental health domain, my research extends across diverse visual fields, e.g. underwater images. I am collaborating with industry partners on cutting-edge challenges, contributing to innovative solutions.

I am grateful to be able to pursue my research in machine learning in the mental health domain with our PhD student Martin Trinhammer, who has a background in psychology. This work extents the grant I got from the Lundbeck Foundation about the same topic, where my collaboration with experts from the psychology domain is paramount. 
We aim at learning more about different mental disorders, to improve their diagnosis, personalize health care, and improve access. While this is challenging in itself, we are working on different aspects of ensuring privacy of the patient data. 

To get a better understanding of my research and interests, please check my [project pages](https://stellagrasshof.com/projects/), my [publications](http://stellagrasshof.com/publications/), and [student projects](http://stellagrasshof.com/studentprojects/). 


Currently, I am happily co-supervising the following two bright PhD students:
- [Leo Vitasovic](https://pure.itu.dk/da/persons/leo-vitasovic) with [Sami S. Brandt](https://pure.itu.dk/da/persons/sami-brandt)
- [Martin Lund Trinhammer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-lund-trinhammer-b94420134/) with [Sami S. Brandt](https://pure.itu.dk/da/persons/sami-brandt)
 
The following PhD students successfully defended under my co-supervision:
- March 2025 [Magnus Ibh](https://pure.itu.dk/en/persons/magnus-ibh) with [Dan Witzner Hansen](https://pure.itu.dk/en/persons/dan-witzner-hansen) and [Pascal Madeleine](https://vbn.aau.dk/da/persons/102245)
- March 2025 [Luiza Ribeiro Marnet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luiza-ribeiro-marnet-378259116) with [Andrzej Wąsowski](http://www.itu.dk/people/wasowski/) and [Yury Brodskiy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yurybrodskiy/)
- November 2023 [René Haas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haasrene/?originalSubdomain=dk) with [Sami S. Brandt](https://pure.itu.dk/da/persons/sami-brandt). (More details about his work can be found [here](http://stellagrasshof.com/projects/3_project/)).
