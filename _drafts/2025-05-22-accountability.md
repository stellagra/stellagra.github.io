It happened to me. I got caught up in my busy work days filled with important meetings and urgent tasks. Student supervision, admin tasks, helping here and there. Trying my best to balance, teaching, supervision, reading, writing, programming, research, and admin tasks.
Always busy, yet always behind, and somehow never making progress on *my* important tasks.
Stop.

What to do?
1. say no.
2. plan better.

# Saying "No"
If you have read about productivity, then it is likely that you have heard this advise before. 
But what does it mean? I don't think it is very difficult in my work context to say no to things, which I truely do not want to do (in case I really don't have to). My challenge is to say no to things which I find interesting. 


# Prioritize 
In the book "Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals", Oliver Burkeman describes beautifully the following well-known predicament.

In a lecture, the professor places a big jar on their desk.
They fill it with rocks. "Is it full?" - "Yes!", the students say convinced. 
They fill it with more pebbles filling out the empty spaces between the rocks. "Is it full now?" - "Yes!?", the students say again. 
They fill the remainder with sand. "Is it full now?" - "Yes!", the students say even more convinced. 
The jar is full to the brim how would anything else fit in.
Finally, they empty a beer into the big presumably already full jar. 

The analogy is supposedly that the large rocks represent the most important things in your life (like family, health, career), the pebbles represent other important but less critical things, and the sand represents the small, less important tasks and possessions. 
And yet at the very end there is always space for a beer with friends.

A professor stands in front of a class with a large empty jar. He fills it with big rocks and asks the students:

    “Is the jar full?”

They say, “Yes.”

Then he adds pebbles, shaking the jar so they settle between the rocks.

    “Is it full now?”

The students again say, “Yes.”

Next, he pours in sand, which fills the remaining space.

    “Now is it full?”

The class laughs and agrees, “Yes, it’s definitely full now.”

Finally, the professor takes out two bottles of beer and pours them into the jar. The liquid seeps into the sand and fills the jar completely.

    The Moral

    The rocks are your most important priorities — family, health, relationships, purpose.
    The pebbles are important but secondary — career, house, hobbies.
    The sand is the small stuff — chores, emails, distractions.
    If you fill your life with sand first, there’s no room for what matters.
    And the beer?
    It’s a reminder that no matter how full life seems, there’s always room for a couple of beers with a friend.

# Planning better

Following common productivity advise, I started to schedule the work I needed to do in my calendar. 
However, it turned out that my plan had a crucial flaw: If I do not show up or do something else than scheduled, there are no consequences. 
Life as an adult is though. Most of the time you are without adult supervision, and you have to parent yourself.
