Learnings from supervising 60 student projects.
I recently became aware, that I crossed in interesting milestone. 
Since I started at the IT University of Copenhagen ca. 5 and a half years ago, I finalized over the supervision of over 50 student projects, hence totalling the number of finalized projects to 60, and over 90 students in total.
