The same boiling water which hardens an egg, softens a potato. 
Diamonds are formed under pressure, but bread raises when it rests.

Learnings from supervising over 60 student projects.
I recently became aware, that I crossed in interesting milestone. 
Since I started at the IT University of Copenhagen in August 2019, I finalized the supervision of over 50 student projects, hence totalling the number of finalized projects to 60, and over 90 students in total.
