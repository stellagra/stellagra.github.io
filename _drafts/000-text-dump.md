## Back to Work
Soon I will be returning back to work at my office after vacation. There are many things I am looking forward to and others which I don't. I feel privileged that I like my job, and can make a living with it. 

I am lucky enough that nobody's life depends on me and my work. 
While some people impose urgency, where I might not see it. While empathy helps me to understand others, I am aware that you do not always have to act as they seem fit.  
If you choose to accommodate everyone who expresses urgency, you let them dictate your life. 
You risk loosing yourself. You decide what is important. Some things are out of your control. Sometimes you might feel there is no way out of a terrible situation.
You have to choose what is important, when you can if you can. It is a privilege to be aware of this choice and to be able to carry it out. 
It also give you back some power. What to do is not their responsibility. It is yours.
