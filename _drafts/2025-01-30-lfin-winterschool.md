"I went to the LFIN2025WinterSchool, and all I got was this nice mug." 
I could say. And it is a nice mug.
But it was so much more...

Thank you organisers and participants a like. It was a pleasure being part of this event and speaking to students. The best I can hope for is that you got one thing out of my talk or the others which you can carry into your bright future.

Thank you Lundbeckfonden / Lundbeck Foundation for making this event possible.
