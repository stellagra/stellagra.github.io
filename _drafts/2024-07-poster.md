Here I describe my approach in creating posters for conferences. 
This is certainly not the best approach for everyone, but it works for me, and hopefully this provides some inspiration for you.

## TLDR; Step-by-step

Without focussing on the content.

1. set up a poster template PowerPoint
2. print the paper in color on page layout
3. distribute the pages of the paper
4. cut out parts of the paper
5. re-arrange parts on a big surface of choice (floor, table, whiteboard with magnets) until the layout is finished
6. arrange elements in PowerPoint correspondingly
7. collect feedback


## Reflection and comments
You might wonder why I use PowerPoint if the paper is written with LaTeX. 
In fact in the past I used LaTeX, but found PowerPoint more flexible, because:
1. it is WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). 
2. I like to move pictures, and textboxes freely by hand, and feel that it gives me more flexibility and less troubles than LaTeX.
3. Equations: In the past I used LaTeX for posters specifically because it was easier to write equations. However, since I discovered the plugin IguanaTex for PowerPoint, this sealed the deal for me.

In conclusion: PowerPoint might not the best tool for posters in general, but it works for me.
