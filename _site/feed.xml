<h2 id="latex-and-powerpoint---the-best-of-both-worlds">LaTeX and Powerpoint - The best of both worlds</h2>

<p>To create presentations most people use either Powerpoint or LaTeX. 
Both have their benefits, and clearly you should select what works best for you. 
Here are my thoughts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I like PowerPoint for presentations with many visuals, because I can intuitively create graphs, and freely move images and videos on the slide, and it just works (most of the time). However, adding equations has always been a bit painful.</li>
  <li>I like LaTeX for academic writing, and presentations with many equations. It allows me to conveniently write equations in a nice and straight-forward manner. However, placing images a certain way, and using animations and videos remains a challenge.</li>
</ul>

<p>It turns out there is tool which allows you to combine the best of both worlds! 
The add-on <a href="https://www.jonathanleroux.org/software/iguanatex/">IguanaTex</a> allows you to incorporate LaTeX equations which are being rendered nicely.</p>

<h2 id="collaborative-academic-writing">Collaborative Academic Writing</h2>

<p>Especially when writing a scientific report with several people, you might benefit greatly from <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">overleaf</a>.</p>

<h2 id="simplify-your-literature-collection">Simplify your Literature Collection</h2>

<p>In the past many researchers struggled with a big pile of research papers. The digitalization offers more convenient solutions! 
For many that meant a folder full of research papers in pdf format.</p>

<p>But here is more! My life got a lot easier when I discovered literature management programs. Obviously there are more than one. 
My tool of choice became <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> which is 
“a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research.”</p>

<p>Why do I like it?</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is open source. (Main reason why I prefer it over mendeley.)</li>
  <li>You can create collections, annotate, and share. It allows collaboration.</li>
  <li>Collect with one click: <a href="https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors">Plugins for your browser</a> allow a direct import of literature from webpages via one click. It creates a bibtex entry, and downloads the pdf automatically - if it is available.</li>
  <li>My favourite recent discovery: You can directly import citations from your zotero into <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">overleaf</a>! Read <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_to_link_your_Overleaf_account_to_Mendeley_and_Zotero">here</a> how to do it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawbacks:
For one reference the retrieved bibtex might differ depending on the website of choice. This should be taken into account especially when using arxiv. If you retrieve the information from this page, you might miss that the paper was officially published in a peer-reviewed venue.</p>

<h2 id="more-to-come">More to come</h2>
<p>There is more to come. 
I would be thrilled to receive input on your favourite tools.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="tools" /><category term="productivity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a growing list of tools which I find helpful.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">René’s PhD defense</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/rene_defense/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="René’s PhD defense" /><published>2023-11-24T20:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-11-24T20:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/rene_defense</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2023/rene_defense/"><![CDATA[<p>Today was the <a href="https://en.itu.dk/Research/PhD-Programme/PhD-Defences/PhD-Defences-2023/November/Rene-Haas">defense</a> of the very first PhD student I had the pleasure to officially co-supervise: René Haas. I could not be prouder. Shortly, after I started working at ITU 2019 we started working together with Sami S. Brandt, on a research project titled <em>Synthesis of Face Images Using Generative Algorithms</em>. This project was then extended into a Master thesis <em>Exploring the latent space of StyleGAN for semantic face editing and expression transfer</em>. 
This lead to a proposal for a PhD project, which got accepted, and the rest is history!</p>

<p>And finally today René defended his thesis with the title <em>Deep Generative Models for Faces and Expressions</em> with great success.

      <div class="abstract hidden">
        <p>Recording real life human motion as a skinned mesh animation with an acceptable quality is usually difficult. Even though recent advances in pose estimation have enabled motion capture from off-the-shelf webcams, the low quality makes it infeasible for use in production quality animation. This work proposes to use recent advances in the prediction of human motion through neural networks to augment low quality human motion, in an effort to bridge the gap between cheap recording methods and high quality recording. First, a model, competitive with prior work in short-term human motion prediction, is constructed. Then, the model is trained to clean up motion from two low quality input sources, mimicking a real world scenario of recording human motion through two webcams. Experiments on simulated data show that the model is capable of significantly reducing noise, and it opens the way for future work to test the model on annotated data.</p>
